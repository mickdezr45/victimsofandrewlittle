        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Andrew Donald Little, operating under ADL Home Building & Constructions, was suspended by the VBA in December 2024. The suspension was due to multiple violations posing risks to public safety and causing financial and emotional harm to clients. The VBA issued a show cause notice with 58 grounds for disciplinary action, including non-compliant fire safety designs, failure to include required safety measures like sprinklers, working without proper insurance, and leaving buildings in non-compliant states requiring costly remediation. Proposed penalties include a three-year disqualification, cancellation of registrations, and fines totaling $160,000. Little has appealed the suspension to VCAT, but it remains in place following court decisions.<a href="https://www.vba.vic.gov.au/news/news/2025/vba-suspends-builder-andrew-little-over-public-safety-concerns-and-issues-%24160%2C000-fine" target="_blank"> (Source)</a></p>
